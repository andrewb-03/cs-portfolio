It begins with why John is on the app. What does he need help with? (budgeting, managing expenses, investment, tracking subscriptions) Afterwards, it asks if John wants to share his data using his SS and banking info, or if he prefers to manually enter his info. If he chooses the latter, it takes him to fill out the information he needs help with (income, average expenses, current bills, etc.). He then receives a message welcoming him to _Limóney_ and a well-wishing of “Happy Savings!”, with an immediate option to work with _Limóney_ to start saving money.
