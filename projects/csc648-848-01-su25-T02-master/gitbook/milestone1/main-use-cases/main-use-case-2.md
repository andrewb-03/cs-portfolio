# Main Use Case 2

* **Actors:**&#x20;
  * Student A
  * Student A’s group of friends
* **Assumptions:**&#x20;
  * Student A is somewhat financially stable&#x20;
* **Use Case:**
  * &#x20;Student A goes eating out with a group of friends once a month. Since they are a large group, it is usually difficult to split the bill among all of them. He pays the bill and expects his friends to reimburse him later, but everyone gets busy and can’t keep track of how much needs to be paid back. The next time they go eating out, he puts the meal on his card. The student goes to the app right away and logs in the transaction. He also has the option of splitting the bill by a number of friends or splitting it by what they order and adding their names. These splits are called reimbursement requests, and the student can even send them to his friends as reminders. The request will be active until it is complete, and the money paid back will reflect on his account balances.&#x20;
* **Benefits for...:**
  * Student A:
    * Student A can keep track of who owes money back to him
  * Student A’s Friends:
    * They are held accountable and become more financially responsible
