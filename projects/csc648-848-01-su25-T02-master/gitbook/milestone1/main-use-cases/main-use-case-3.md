  * Erik (Busy College Student)
  * _Limóney_ (Company)
* **Assumptions:**
  * Erik juggles school and work on a packed schedule.&#x20;
  * He stores physical receipts but forgets to log them at the end of the day.&#x20;
  * Erik prefers to manually enter his expenses for privacy reasons.&#x20;
  * He does not use updated bank tools.&#x20;
* **Use Case:**
  * &#x20;Erik tries to keep track of his spending, but with work and school, he tends to forget about his receipts, which pile up. Logging the receipts by hand feels like too much. One day, _Limóney_ sends out a reminder and suggests that he can scan the receipts via his camera instead. Erik tries it and is surprised by how quickly and efficiently it works. Erik is now logging expenses through _Limóney_ because it provides a simple way to keep track of his receipts and has become a nightly routine.&#x20;
* **Benefits for ...:**
  *   Users:

      * Users have an easier time logging receipts with the camera scanner.
      * Users get helpful reminders help Erik stay on track.
      * Users with no technical skill have an easier time managing their finances.&#x20;
