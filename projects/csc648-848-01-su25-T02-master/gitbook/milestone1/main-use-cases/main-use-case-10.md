# Main Use Case 10

* **Actors:**&#x20;
  * John
  * LemonAid
* **Assumptions:**
  * John is familiar with the concept of a Chatbot and feels comfortable using it, understanding it is only for reference and will not be 100% accurate
  * John likes the idea of having his entries analyzed and would like to have an outside perspective on his savings without sacrificing his privacy
* **Use Case:**
  * John has successfully signed up and is enjoying using _Limóney_. However, all the technical jargon and the routine of inputting and reading numbers gets tiring. He wants to take a bit of a break and wants to be able to discuss his finances with others. He opens LemonAid, the company’s financial aid assistance, and asks it for help. To streamline the process, LemonAid asks John how exactly it can help him today, while providing several recommendations that he can click on or directing him to enter his own question in the text field.&#x20;
* **Benefits for …:**&#x20;
  * Users:
    * Users shall be able to discuss their finances with an AI assistant, allowing them not only to receive feedback from it, but also allowing them to think more deeply on the subject matter they are asking about. All while maintaining their privacy and not being required to share their finances with others.
  * Company:
    * The company shall be able to streamline the feedback process and make communication much easier. If users choose to share their chat information, the company can use it to further develop the AI and train it to be prepared for more situations.
