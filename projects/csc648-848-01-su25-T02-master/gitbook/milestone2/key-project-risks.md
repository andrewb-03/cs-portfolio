# Key Project Risks

* **Skills risks**
  * Each individual of the group has familiarity with one or more of the concepts of this project from the technical documentation to the prototype itself. What everyone shares is the desire to learn and push oneself. So, if someone comes across a task that they are unfamiliar with, they are likely to reach out several sources to learn.&#x20;
* **Schedule risks**
  * Time is very limited for all the members given that we all have responsibilities outside of this class. However, with proper planning and communication, we can meet the deadlines.&#x20;
* **Technical risks**
  * Given that our cloud server host has very limited vCPU and RAM, there will be difficulties. With just our mere about us page in milestone 1, there was an issue with overloading the RAM that it crashed the server. To solve this, we will try to finish prototypes earlier to give the backend team time to adjust for a smooth deployment for this and future milestones.&#x20;
* **Teamwork risks**&#x20;
  * If people are not communicative with what they are struggling with, there will be a delay in progress. So, to minimize that from happening, there are consistent check-ins on everyone to invite open communication and to keep everyone up to date.&#x20;
* **Legal/content risks**&#x20;
  * To legally use all required software in Lim√≥ney, we must ensure any UI kits, AI tools, and APIs are properly licensed, especially for commercial use. Services like OpenAI require a paid plan if used in a production setting. As well, we must include clear disclosures that your AI assistant provides suggestions, not professional financial or legal advice.
