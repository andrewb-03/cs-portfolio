# M3v1 Feedback and Prototype Grading

I really enjoy working with this team. You are one of the few groups that have shown steady progress throughout the entire semester, consistently learning from your mistakes and striving to improve.

**Emily**, you are doing a fantastic job leading the team. Your clear and consistent communication has been key, and it really stands out.

**Andrew**, I noticed that your participation in this milestone was limited. I encourage you to take a more active role in the next milestone to stay aligned with the team’s momentum.

Keep up the great work, everyone!

**Prototype Grade:** 7/7

## Checkpoint 1

### Network Diagram

- **Network Diagram:** This still needs more development. While you have included a basic explanation of the protocols used, much of the information must be inferred by the reader.  
  For example, the Local Area Network is missing from the diagram. This is a critical component, as it includes the supported devices and their network protocols (e.g., TV, laptop, desktop).  
  It's also unclear whether the front-end and back-end components are hosted in the cloud. A cloud instance typically runs multiple protocols, including those operating on the gateway, and this should be clearly depicted.

## Checkpoint 2

- There are a few minor usability issues, as we discussed in class. Overall, though, I’m very impressed with the UI work. There’s a lot of creativity in this team, and the logo looks great.

## Checkpoint 3

- Excellent job. The code is clean, well-documented, and very well organized.
