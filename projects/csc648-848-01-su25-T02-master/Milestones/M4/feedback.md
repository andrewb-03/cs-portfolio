# General Feedback 

I’m not sure what happened with this milestone. It seems the team may have relaxed after winning best milestone last time. However, this submission needs substantial work and includes several incomplete sections—either partially or fully.

I also noticed that many team members were absent or not fully engaged during the UI/UX and QA lectures, based on the quality of work submitted here.

Most of these mistakes could have been avoided by paying closer attention in class or reviewing the recorded lectures.

As per the syllabus policy, a 20% deduction will be applied to your final milestone grade due to the incomplete Localization section.

Please make sure to address all issues in M4v2.

Beta Prototype Grade: 13/14


## Usability Tests 

This section needs to be completely reworked.

Missing components:

1. Five test plans (one per function tested).

2. The provided test plan does not follow the format shown on slide 17. Each plan must include all components listed there (as covered in class and in the recordings).

3. The testing table is missing required columns and does not follow naming conventions discussed in class. Refer to slide 24. Specifically:
   - The column should be labeled `% completed` (not "success rate").
   - You are also missing the `errors` column.

4. The Likert satisfaction section needs revision:
   - Many statements are not useful for gauging user satisfaction.
   - Statements must not be repeated.
   - All statements must be original.
   - The form must match the format on slide 35.

## QA Testing

All required test plans are missing. One plan per non-functional requirement was expected.

## Localization Testing

No localization testing was provided.

## Code Review 

All code reviews from previous milestones are missing.

**Emily:** You were supposed to be reviewing and approving code for merge into the main branch since Milestone 1. The only proof provided is from "yesterday."

## Beta Prototype 

You're doing a good job with the project overall. However, I noticed that some elements in the UI are still hardcoded. In the Beta prototype, hardcoded data was not allowed, as I was also grading the functionality of both the database and the backend.

Additionally, please center the limon animation on the homepage. Right now, it appears slightly padded to the left and too close to the text.


Keep up the good work, team!
