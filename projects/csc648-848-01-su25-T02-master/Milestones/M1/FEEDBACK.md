# Milestone 1 Docs Revision

## General Feedback

- This milestone shows potential; however, there are important issues the team must address, such as lack of attention to detail and failure to follow in-class instructions and guidelines.
- While it is understandable that some details may be missed during lectures, students are encouraged to review the class recordings and attend office hours. I am always available and happy to provide support.
- I believe this team has strong potential, but you need to believe in yourselves as well.
- Only two files should be in the `milestones/M1/` folder: `m1v1.pdf` and `m1v2.pdf` (or their Markdown equivalents). Avoid placing additional files in this folder, as it made locating your submission unnecessarily difficult. All files must be properly organized within the correct directory.

## Main Page

- **Emily**: Please include your email address after your name (only the team lead's email is required).

## Executive Summary

- This section is well-written. The overall product vision is clearly communicated, and the unique features are described effectively.

## Main Use Cases

- The use cases are well-articulated; however, please ensure consistent formatting across all diagrams. 
- Currently, it is obvious that different team members created these diagrams, which is acceptable internally but may be confusing to external readers.
- Maintain a consistent and unified presentation style.

## List of Main Data Items and Entities

- As discussed in class, specific attributes are not expected at this early stage. The focus should remain exploratory and high-level.
- For instance, specifying attributes like `total` or `account type` under a `Balance` entity is unnecessary. Please revise to focus solely on entity identification.

## Initial List of Functional Requirements

This section needs to be completely redone due to several major issues:

1. The format does not match what was taught in class. For instance, instead of saying “Register a new account,” write:  
   *“The User shall be able to create an account.”*  
   Ambiguous or informal statements are not acceptable.

2. All previously defined entities must be linked to specific functional requirements. If an entity is listed but not involved in any functionality, it should not be included.

3. Organize your entities using numbered groups. For example:  
   - `1. Regular User`  
   - `2. Registered User`

4. The current list is too short. Additional requirements must be added to match the functionality described in your Use Cases section.

## List of Non-Functional Requirements

- Several categories are missing, such as:
  - Coding Standards
  - Look and Feel
  - Privacy (distinct from Compliance)

- More detail is needed. For example, under **Supportability**, include browser support requirements, such as:  
  *“The system shall be supported by Safari browser version 11.1.1.”*

- Avoid specifying only the latest browser versions. Most users do not update immediately.

## Competitive Analysis

This section must be completely reworked. Current issues include:

1. The high-level comparison table is missing competitor URLs. These were required for verification of your research.
2. The purpose of the first table seems misunderstood. This is not a checkmark table; it is meant to document research findings. Refer to the lecture slides and recordings.
3. The detailed feature comparison table must follow the established format:
   - `-` = Not implemented
   - `+` = Implemented
   - `++` = Your team will improve it

   A legend must be included. Without it, the table is unclear.

4. The summary is incomplete. It should present a thorough, non-technical analysis of your findings and how your product's unique features emerge from this research.

## Checklist

- The checklist is generally solid.
- I strongly recommend attending office hours regularly. Many other teams meet with me to review their work before submission, which results in stronger milestones. I suggest at least one or two quick check-ins per milestone.

## List of Contributions

- **Andrew**: This time, I accepted your contribution submitted by Emily on your behalf. This will not be allowed for future milestones. 
- Starting from Milestone 2, you must submit your own work to the repository. Credit will only be given to the contributor who commits the work.

## Next Steps

1. Move `m1v1.pdf` to the `milestones/M1/` directory.
2. Freeze `m1v1.pdf` (no further edits allowed). This serves as a time snapshot to evaluate progress.
3. Create a copy named `m1v2` and revise all feedback provided above.
4. Submit `m1v2` to the same directory once revisions are complete.
5. Begin work on `m2v1`.

> **Note:**  
> `m1v2` is due by the same deadline as `m2v1`, but it should be revised earlier. The quality and clarity of `m2v1` depend directly on how well you revise `m1v2`.
